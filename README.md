# Working with Unix Processes

A repository inspired in the chapters of the book [Working with Unix processes](http://pragprog.com/book/jsunix/working-with-unix-processes).

## To run the program

Make sure you have Ruby 2.6.3 installed.

Run ```bin/execute``` and follow the instructions in the main menu. You should be guided through the chapters of the book.
NOTE: As some of the classes create child processes and open files, it is a good idea to quit and restart after entering too many chapters.

#### Otherwise, make sure you know how to kill a process
