# Working with Unix Processes Program

A Ruby program freely inspired in the chapters of the book "Working With Unix Processes" by Jesse Storimer. This program reduces a lot of the chapters and is not intended to replace the book, just serve as a repository of the examples.

## To run the program

Make sure you have Ruby 2.6.3 installed.

Run ```bin/execute``` and follow the instructions in the main menu. You should be guided through the chapters of the book.
